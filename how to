basic how to--------------

Open a new Colab notebook → add three cells below.

Cell 1 — Clone + install
# ⬇️ CHANGE this to your repo URL
REPO_URL = "https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git"

!git clone {REPO_URL}
%cd <your-repo>
!pip install -q -r requirements.txt


Cell 2 — Add docs + set ONE API key
# Option 1: Quickly create a sample doc
!mkdir -p data
with open("data/sample.txt","w",encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write("""Travel Policy
- Meals capped at $50/day
- Hotels require pre-approval
- Reimburse within 30 days with receipts
""")

# Option 2: Or upload your own files via Colab's Files pane into /content/<your-repo>/data
# 🔑 Set ONE provider (comment out the one you’re not using)
import os
# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."         # OpenAI
os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = "your_gemini_key"   # Gemini


Cell 3 — Ask a question (one-shot)
!python ask.py "What is the daily meal cap and reimbursement deadline?"
That’s it. You’ll see an Answer and Sources printed.
